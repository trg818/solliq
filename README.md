This program calculates and plots solidus and liquidus curves for some geomaterials, in particular peridotitic and basaltic rock, some minerals, and iron-sulfur alloys. The original code is the `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook; the plain Python 3 version (`.py`) is provided for convenience as generated by the Jupyter export filter.
